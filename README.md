This code demonstrates various image processing and analysis techniques using Python libraries such as OpenCV, Matplotlib, PIL, and scikit-image. The notebook covers the following steps:

  1. Image Upload: The notebook starts by allowing the user to upload an image file using Google Colab's file upload feature.

  2. Image Conversion (BGR to RGB): The uploaded image is read using OpenCV and converted from BGR to RGB format. The converted image is then displayed using Matplotlib.

  3. Image Saving: The converted image is saved as output_image.jpg.

  4. Image Analysis: The notebook includes various image analysis techniques such as:

  5. Local Binary Pattern (LBP): A texture descriptor that summarizes local patterns in an image.

  6. Labeling: Identifying and labeling connected components in an image.

  7. Edge Detection: Using filters to detect edges in the image.

  8. Histogram Equalization: Enhancing the contrast of the image by equalizing its histogram.

Requirements:

To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

  1. cv2 (OpenCV)

  2. matplotlib.pyplot

  3. PIL (Pillow)

  4. numpy
