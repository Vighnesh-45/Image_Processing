This code demonstrates various image processing and analysis techniques using Python libraries such as OpenCV, Matplotlib, PIL, and scikit-image. The notebook covers the following steps:

Image Upload: The notebook starts by allowing the user to upload an image file using Google Colab's file upload feature.

Image Conversion (BGR to RGB): The uploaded image is read using OpenCV and converted from BGR to RGB format. The converted image is then displayed using Matplotlib.

Image Saving: The converted image is saved as output_image.jpg.

Image Analysis: The notebook includes various image analysis techniques such as:

Local Binary Pattern (LBP): A texture descriptor that summarizes local patterns in an image.

Labeling: Identifying and labeling connected components in an image.

Edge Detection: Using filters to detect edges in the image.

Histogram Equalization: Enhancing the contrast of the image by equalizing its histogram.

Requirements:

To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

cv2 (OpenCV)

matplotlib.pyplot

PIL (Pillow)
